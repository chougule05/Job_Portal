in python terminal

>>pip3 install virtualenv

we use this if we are working as group on a project. it makes all of the requirements all the packages that are needed are contained within the project itself and not on our system. So that you can easily transfer the project around and everyone can just install the requirements into working directory and have exact setup that you had, So it makes easier to work with.

>>virtualenv env
>>env/bin/activate
 to get inside the environment

>>pip3 install flask flask-sqlalchemy


in Python

# create new file in python


from flask import flask

app = Flask(__name__)
# this is done for referencing this file


#indexing route so that when we browse it does'nt immediately just show 404. in flask you set up routes with the app route decorator.so app dot route

@app.route('/') #url string of our route
def index():
	return "hello world"

if __name__="__main__":
	app.run(debug=True) # if there is any debug on the web page we can able to see

>>python3 app.py
